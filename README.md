Space Shooters is a game similar to Galaga and Space Invaders. The player must defeat all 40 enemies in order to advance ot the next level. The player has 3 lives before it is game over. Furthermore, the enemies also shoot back at them and the difficult of the game increases dramatically with each level.

The songs found in the game, "A Night of Dizzy Spells" and "Come and Find Me - B Mix" were created by Eric Skiff. 
These songs, along with more of his work, can be found on: http://ericskiff.com/music/

The sound effect of the player or enemy being hit by a bullet was found on: http://soundbible.com/tags-explosion.html
